# 🌟 Problem 8: Custom Event Emitter 🌟  

Welcome to the eighth challenge in the Node.js practical problem series! 🚀 This time, we’ll dive into Node.js’s **event-driven architecture** by creating and using a custom event emitter. Get ready to learn one of the most powerful concepts in Node.js! 💻  

---  

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Create a Node.js script that demonstrates the use of the `EventEmitter` class from the `events` module. The script should:  

1. Define a custom event.  
2. Attach a listener to handle the event.  
3. Emit the event with some data.  

---  

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- Understand the role of events in Node.js.  
- Learn how to use the `EventEmitter` class to create custom events.  
- Practice attaching event listeners and emitting events.  

---  

## 📂 Project Structure  

Your project folder should look like this:  

```bash  
problem-8-event-emitter/  
├── emitter.js         # The main script demonstrating custom event emitter usage  
├── README.md          # Documentation for this problem  
└── package.json       # Project configuration file  
```

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you’ve completed the basics, try adding:

- Multiple Events: Define and handle multiple custom events.

- Event Parameters: Pass additional data when emitting events and handle it in listeners.

- Asynchronous Events: Use asynchronous event listeners with setImmediate or process.nextTick.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How to create and use an instance of the EventEmitter class.

- Attach single or multiple listeners to an event.

Handle and pass data with events in Node.js.
